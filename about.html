		<div class="me_content">
			<p>
				I was introduced to vast world of coding when I had Java and Object Oriented Programming as a part of the course curriculum 
				in 8th standard. Back then, I was fascinated by what power coding held. I mean, writing a few lines of code to make a computer
				do anything, that was a mind = blown deal for me. Since then, my sole goal has been to unlock the potential of coding to increase
				human interaction with a machine and then make daily tasks easier by automating them using any machine with computational power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although my passion is using my coding skills to solve a particular problem, its not always coding and sitting in front of
				the screen looking at a bunch of random words filling tons of lines. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Some of my <span class="sub_heading">HOBBIES</span> include the following activity:
			</p>
			<ul class="hobbies">
				<li>I love to capture the world around me using photography</li>
				<li>Huge fan of <strike>watching</strike> <em>binge watching</em> sitcoms. Try naming one I haven't seen yet</li>
				<li>A badminton match is always welcome. Just try not to be a sore looser!!</li>
				<li>It would be called lying and that too a bad one if I told you I dont love playing video games
					I am one of those who has a gaming room in his dream home along with a snacks counter.
