This is a repository containing all the files that collectively run the v1 of my portfolio website online for others to see at [https://muditgarg48.github.io](https://muditgarg48-v1.onrender.com)
Do visit if you have the time, this was my first ever project during college at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The assets folder contains all the necessary files to make the website look pretty.
It contains a images folder to store all the images used in the website.
It also contains the stylesheets folder to store all the CSS files for the website
