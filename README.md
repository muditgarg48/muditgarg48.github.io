## Motivation

- I always wanted to have a online front, an online portfolio to depict myself. 
- I wanted to have the full control over my portfolio website, continuously tweaking and improving the design, content, and not be based on those templated portfolio builders, providing me with practical knowledge about UI/UX design, responsive and performant web development and SEO optimisation.
- Just after my postgraduation in 2024, I started picking up React in an attempt to broaded my skillset and wanted to practise it. 
- Ever since the completion of Portfolio Website v1 in 2020, I always wanted to shift my portfolio website (based on pure HTML-CSS-JavaScript) to a more framework based single page application.

## Key Features

#### v1

- Clear tab based view for separate HTML pages with necessary information including skills, education history, projects and certifications.
- Points of contact redirects

#### v2 

- SPA with responsive and performant UI and optimised assets for all devices.
- All necessary information with more in-depth insights and optimised screen real-estate usage.

- Introduction of portfolio data store utilising GitHub CDN to provide website data and avoid hard coded data in the main portfolio repository. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/muditgarg48/portfolio_data).
- Introduction of A.L.F.R.E.D., RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based chatbot, responsive for ingested all the information on the website to answer any queries by the visitor in a human conversation format. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/muditgarg48/self-rag-system).
